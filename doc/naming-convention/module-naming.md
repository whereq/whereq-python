# Python module Convention > Module Naming

## snake_case
- Should be all in lowercase letters such as requests, math
- If contains multiple words, it should be separated by underscores (_) e.g. expression_engine.py
- Should resonate with the class or methods inside the module

```python
from math import factorial
classÂ Car:
    ...
```
