# Python-Gif-Ascii-Animator
This project intends to convert an animated gif into an ascii representation and print this representation into the console. 

This is just a fun side project I decided to do one afternoon. It started as me trying to make a progress bar on the command line and it....evolved....into something really cool!

This project can take any animated gif extract the frames as seperate images, turn those images into ascii string representations of the image and then print these onto the console.
In short it make a cool little animation.

I also decided to add sound to the project using pygame's mixer, so if you want to include sound you will need to install pygame.

...I may have gone a little crazy....





side note: I want to give credit where credit is due, I found a very good snippet of code online that does the bulk of the image to
ascii conversion and rather than try to continue developing my own(very ugly) solution I decided to include theirs.
the code found in the convert_image_to_ascii function was based on the code found here: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/580702-image-to-ascii-art-converter/
